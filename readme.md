# About

This is a Scanner generator that works along the lines of flex, a popular C++ parser generator.

An example project is included to demonstrate the current capabilities.
Some of the files need to be rearranged for better organization, but the basics are there.

## Regular Expressions

Regexes currently have a rudamentary implementation. All possibilities are as follows:

\*: Kleene star. Zero or more of the preceeding letters. It is best to wrap this in parentheses, as expressions like a(ba)* will allow '' and force an 'aba' pattern.

(): Parentheses. An expression in parentheses will be evaluated on its own - it's a recursive algorithm. When in doubt, use more.

\[\*-\*\]: A macro for adding a set of characters. Uses the character value to check whether it is between first and second, for example [a-z] will allow all lowercase letters.

|: Or. Will allow the entire left half of the expression or the entire right half, so it should be used with parentheses - a(a|b) allows aa or ab

## Definitions

There is an example of definitions included in the project. All text within a usings bracket will be placed at the top of the generated code.
Return should give the return type of the expression - default is int. 
Error should give the error value - default is -1.
Endtype should give the end of file value - default is 0.


Between begin and and are the expressions. All regex should be placed between brackets, followed by a colon and curly brackets containing your code.
This code is place verbatim into the generated C# as a lambda expression. In the future I will include an example that shows how to get the value of the parsed string.

%return {Types}
%errortype {Types.Error}
%endtype {Types.End}

%begin

[int] : { return Types.INT; }
[([1-9])([0-9]*)] : { return Types.Num; }
["((([#-Z^-~])|(\\"|\r|\n|\t|\[|\]))*)"] : { return Types.STRING; }
[([a-zA-Z])(([a-zA-Z0-9])*)] : { return Types.IDENTIFIER; }
[\w(\w*)] : { return Lex(); }

%end
```
